# Historical-analysis-of-returns

**INTRO**

This script analyzes historical data from the most relevant asset classetsand compares its returns against the most basic and common portfolio composed
of 60/40 stocks/bonds.

**SOURCE**

The source of the data is NYU Professor Mr.Damodaran and his periodically updated database:
https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html

Attached to this repository two excel documents cleaned and with extra indicators incorporated by me, such as the M2 (Money supply indicator, FED source).

**IDEA AND FINDINGS**

The idea of this project is to obtain one function that plots the average annualized return per asset class on each decade since 1940 and then visualize
in a bar chart (among other relevant graphs such as the returns per asset or the grotwh of the different portfolios). This graph offers a good perspective given the current macroeconomic environment, as this decade itÂ´s being compared to the 1940s/1970s. With the help of this function is much easier to see which asset classes could potentially benefit during periods of high inflation.

**FEEDBACK**

Potential improvements: 

   -Adding more asset classes.

   -Backtesting of different complex strategies

   -Pull data online for key macro indicators.
